# SwiftBinaryTree

This is a really simple binary tree implimentation that includes a builder to make building trees easier. I don't plan on updating this unless there is some dependency issue and especially not to change any one-liners. Also includes tests

If you want to credit me that's great, but this is so small and there are many other alternatives so I don't really care too much.
